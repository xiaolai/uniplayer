// A caching proxy in front of TMDB, so the player never carries an API key.
//
// It exists for three reasons, and the key is the least of them.
//
//  1. **The key stays here.** Baked into the client it would be one anonymous
//     credential shared by every copy, which is what the TMDB terms call
//     attempting to conceal the identity of an application (§1.C) — and handing
//     it to every user reads uncomfortably like sublicensing a licence that is
//     explicitly non-sublicensable (§1.A). One identified server calling on
//     behalf of one identified application is the ordinary shape and raises
//     neither question.
//  2. **TMDB is not reachable everywhere.** Access from Russia is unreliable in
//     practice, which is why every comparable player grew a proxy of its own.
//     Without one the catalog is simply blank for those viewers.
//  3. **Caching is what makes the rate limit a non-issue**, and TMDB recommend
//     it themselves. Their CDN allows roughly 50 requests/second and 20
//     concurrent connections *per IP*, and a proxy turns that from a per-user
//     budget into a shared ceiling — so the cache is not an optimisation here,
//     it is the thing that makes the architecture work at all.
//
// The shape of the traffic is what makes the ceiling generous: trending is one
// upstream request per language per TTL, serving every viewer's panel; a film's
// metadata does not change, so details cache for days. Only free-text search
// has a real tail, and it is the only thing that sets the rate.
//
// **What this does not do is log queries.** A proxy sees what everybody is
// searching for, which is a step backwards from the client calling TMDB
// directly, and the only honest compensation is to keep none of it. Access logs
// are deliberately absent; what is counted is totals, never terms.
