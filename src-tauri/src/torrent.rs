//! Torrent streaming (ROADMAP 21): a magnet link becomes a URL mpv can open.
//!
//! The architecture is the settled one — peerflix, Stremio and webtorrent all
//! work this way. A torrent client inside the process runs a local HTTP server;
//! mpv opens `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/…` and its Range requests *are* the signal
//! for "the viewer is here", which the client turns into piece priority.
//! [librqbit](https://lib.rs/crates/librqbit) already does that half: it blocks
//! a read until the piece arrives and prioritizes what is being streamed.
//!
//! Four decisions in here are worth stating, because each one is a place the
//! obvious implementation is wrong.
//!
//! **The session is lazy.** Creating one opens sockets, joins the DHT and starts
//! talking to strangers. The overwhelming majority of launches never open a
//! magnet, and a video player that joins a peer-to-peer network on startup is
//! not one people would keep. So it is built on the first `torrent_add` and not
//! before.
//!
//! **The identity lives in the URL path, not in the port.** A stream is served
//! from `/t/<infohash>/<index>/<name.mkv>`, so `sourceId()` on the frontend can
//! read `torrent:<infohash>/<index>` straight out of the URL with no extra state
//! to keep in sync. The port is deliberately not part of it: it is ephemeral and
//! changes every run, which is exactly why a key taken from the transport
//! forgets the file every session (ROADMAP 20). The trailing file name is not
//! decoration either — it gives ffmpeg an extension to probe by and the player a
//! name to show.
//!
//! **What gets downloaded is decided by what is being read, not up front.** A
//! torrent holding a season is twelve episodes, and selecting them all to watch
//! one would pull ~30 GB for a 45-minute view. The torrent is therefore added
//! *paused* with nothing selected, and the HTTP handler itself puts a file into
//! `only_files` and unpauses when a request for it arrives. That is the same
//! principle as piece priority one level up — the reader steers the download —
//! and it is what lets the frontend hand mpv a playlist of every video in the
//! torrent without any of them costing anything until it is played.
//!
//! **The server is loopback-only, on an ephemeral port.** This is a private
//! channel between us and our own mpv, not a service. Binding `127.0.0.1:0`
//! means no fixed port to collide with a second instance and nothing reachable
//! from the network.
//!
//! Not done here, and deliberately: buffered ranges on the seekbar. librqbit
//! keeps the piece bitmap behind `pub(crate) with_chunk_tracker`, so the finest
//! public measure is `TorrentStats::file_progress` — bytes per file, which is a
//! percentage and not a map. Drawing *where* the holes are needs either an
//! upstream accessor or our own tracking of what the stream has served.
