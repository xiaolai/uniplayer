/// Raise the open-file limit before anything in this process can spend it.

/// **launchd hands a GUI application a soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` of 256**, and this
/// player is not a program that can live inside it: librqbit holds one open
/// descriptor per file of every torrent in its session — a Blu-ray release is
/// 79 of them by itself — beside the peer sockets, mpv's own connections to the
/// loopback stream server, the webview and Metal's shader caches.
///
/// Running out is not the failure it sounds like, and that is the whole reason
/// this is here. `EMFILE` on a socket is visible and recoverable; what is
/// neither is what macOS does to the media stack when a subsystem is reached
/// for the *first* time while the table is full. Measured: a cold
/// `AudioComponentInstanceNew` answers **-1** (mpv logs it as
/// `unable to open audio component ([255][255][255][255]/-1)` and falls back to
/// an `avfoundation` output that never advances its clock), and
/// `VTIsHardwareDecodeSupported(kCMVideoCodecType_HEVC)` answers **0**, which
/// reaches libavcodec as `kVTCouldNotFindVideoDecoderErr` — "VideoToolbox
/// decoder for this format not found" — and drops every hwdec rung into
/// software. **Both verdicts are then cached for the life of the process**:
/// measured, they still fail after every descriptor has been released, so one
/// brief moment at the ceiling costs the session its hardware decoding and its
/// audio clock, and with mpv syncing video to audio the picture simply stops.
/// On screen that is a player whose pause button toggles while the position
/// never moves, with nothing anywhere to connect it to a file limit.
///
/// librqbit ships the helper for this and its own CLI calls it; embedding the
/// library means inheriting the obligation. The hard limit under launchd is
/// unlimited, and the crate knows the stricter ceiling macOS keeps in
/// `kern.maxfilesperproc`, so this is one call and not a negotiation.
