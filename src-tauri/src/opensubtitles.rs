//! Subtitle search and download through the OpenSubtitles REST API.
//!
//! Everything here follows what the live API actually answered on 2026-08-03,
//! not what the documentation implies — several details differ and each one
//! changes the code:
//!
//! * **The rate limit is 5 requests per second**, not the 1/s our research
//!   assumed (`ratelimit-limit: 5`, with `ratelimit-remaining` counting down
//!   and `ratelimit-reset: 1`). That is why a search may safely make a second
//!   request when the first one comes back empty.
//! * **Searching is not quota'd at all; downloading is.** Anonymous callers get
//!   5 downloads per 24 h per IP, an account 10–1000 — and a consumer marked
//!   *Under Development* gets 100/day with **no user authentication whatsoever**
//!   (measured: an anonymous `POST /download` returned 200 with
//!   `remaining: 99`). So the download button works before anybody signs in,
//!   and signing in is what raises the ceiling rather than what unlocks the
//!   feature.
//! * A hash search marks its results with `moviehash_match`, which is the only
//!   trustworthy "this is for your exact file" signal — a text query is fuzzy
//!   enough that searching "interstellar" puts a documentary *about* the film
//!   first.
//! * The `User-Agent` must name the application and version; the `Api-Key`
//!   header goes on every request, search included.
//!
//! The API key identifies the *application*, never the user: OpenSubtitles bans
//! apps that make their users register their own keys. It is therefore shipped
//! with the binary, cannot be a secret, and is deliberately replaceable without
//! a release — see `api_key`.

// buys is silent re-login once the token expires.
