//! DLNA/UPnP AV reconnaissance: is there a MediaRenderer on this network, and
//! what does it say it can play?
//!
//! Why this exists at all, with Cast already shipped: a DLNA renderer is the
//! **TV's own player**, not a browser pipeline, so its format list is the set
//! the television actually decodes — routinely MKV, HEVC and E-AC-3, i.e. the
//! releases our prepare rung exists to repack. And unlike Cast it answers a
//! real capability question: `ConnectionManager::GetProtocolInfo` returns the
//! Sink list, which is the API whose absence forced the per-cell probing in
//! casting.md.
//!
//! **The branch proved out and this is a shipping transport** — the second half
//! of the file is the command surface the frontend drives. What survives from
//! the reconnaissance is the parsing: there is still no XML crate, because what
//! is wanted out of these documents is a dozen leaf elements and a service list,
//! and a real parser is a dependency plus a licensing entry for that. The cost
//! of the decision is paid in [`open_tag_end`] and [`unescape`], which handle
//! the shapes vendors actually emit — attributes, namespace prefixes, empty
//! elements, entities — and in the fixtures under `mod tests`, which are the
//! only place a device we do not own can be reproduced. If the string scanning
//! ever has to grow a third special case, that is the signal to take the
//! dependency instead.
//!
//! Everything here is written for the general renderer rather than for the one
//! television it was measured on: the MIME spelling, the `Seek` unit and the
//! resolution of relative control URLs are all negotiated or derived from what
//! the device said, not assumed.
//!
//! Run it against the LAN with `FP_DLNA_PROBE=1 npm run tauri:macos` — it has to
//! run inside the app rather than from `cargo test`, because on macOS 15+ a
//! process without Local Network permission has its multicast silently dropped
//! and every answer here would be a false negative.
