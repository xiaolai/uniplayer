//! The catalog: **what** to watch (TMDB) and **where to get it** (a
//! Torznab-compatible indexer).
//!
//! Two services and the split between them is the whole design. TMDB answers
//! "which film is this" — posters, localised titles, descriptions, how many
//! seasons a series has. An indexer answers "which releases exist for it" —
//! trackers, quality, dubs, seeders, a magnet. Neither can do the other's job:
//! an indexer holds no posters and no descriptions, so browsing one directly is
//! a list of raw release names, which is precisely the experience a catalog
//! exists to replace.
//!
//! ## There is no TMDB key in this binary, and that is the point
//!
//! Metadata goes through **our own proxy** (`services/tmdb`), which holds the
//! key. Baking one into the client was considered and rejected on the terms
//! rather than on the load: it would be a single anonymous credential shared by
//! every copy, which is what TMDB call attempting to conceal an application's
//! identity (§1.C), and handing it to every user reads like sublicensing a
//! licence that is explicitly non-sublicensable (§1.A). That the rate limit is
//! per-IP says only that a shared key costs TMDB no *load* — a fact about
//! capacity, not a permission, and conflating the two is the mistake to avoid
//! here.
//!
//! The proxy's address is a setting for the same reason the relay's is:
//! self-hosting is a setting, not a fork. An empty field means the default.
//!
//! ## Where the posters come from, and why the client decides
//!
//! Poster bytes are the whole of the bandwidth — a grid of twenty is roughly
//! 800 KB against ~25 KB of JSON for the same screen — so the cheapest possible
//! answer is to **not proxy them at all** and let the webview fetch straight
//! from TMDB's own CDN, which is closer to the viewer than any server of ours.
//! That works for most people and fails for the ones TMDB is not reachable
//! from, which is a real population rather than a hypothetical.
//!
//! So this returns the poster **path**, never a URL, and the frontend composes
//! one against whichever base it has found to work — see `posterUrl` in
//! `catalog.svelte.ts`. Deciding it there rather than here is deliberate: the
//! question is "can this webview load that image", and the honest way to answer
//! it is to try, not to infer it from an address. Geolocating the client IP
//! would need a database, would be wrong for anyone on a VPN, and would make
//! the service derive somebody's location from their address in order to guess
//! at something it can simply be told.
//!
//! ## Why this runs in Rust rather than in the webview
//!
//! The proxy address is user-supplied and arbitrary, so calling it from the
//! page would put an arbitrary host into the webview's fetch surface — the same
//! objection as the indexer's. And **reqwest sends no `User-Agent` at all** —
//! the trap the tracker announce and every UPnP call in this tree have already
//! paid for — so the one place that fixes it is a shared client, which also
//! keeps the connection pool alive across a search that makes two or three
//! calls.
//!
//! ## What travels
//!
//! A typed query and nothing else. Unlike subtitle search, nothing here is
//! derived from a file on disk — the viewer is looking for something they do
//! not have yet — so there is no path to gate against the privacy roots. That
//! stops being true the moment anything asks "which releases exist for the file
//! I am watching", and such a feature would need the gate before it ships.
