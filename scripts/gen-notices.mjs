// **This is not paperwork.** The player links libmpv, FFmpeg, libplacebo and
// friends dynamically, all of them LGPL-2.1, and every one of those wants a
// prominent notice naming it, a copy of its license and a route to its source.
// Until this file existed the bundle carried none of the three. Frame Player's
// own GPL-3.0 asks for the same of itself, which is why its LICENSE is embedded
// here as well rather than only sitting beside the executable: the dialog that
// shows this file is then the one place that answers every license question.
//
// Rendering reads only committed inputs — the manifest, the texts, the two
// dependency snapshots and the patches — so `--check` runs anywhere, including
// the Node-only CI job. Talking to cargo and npm is `--refresh`, which a human
// runs.
//
// The one thing rendering *does* look at, when it happens to be present, is the
// macOS library set on disk: every dylib there must be covered by the manifest.
// That is the check that makes this file follow the build instead of drifting
// away from it, and it is why `libs` exists in the manifest at all.
