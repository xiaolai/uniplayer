# dmgbuild settings for the UniPlayer disk image.
#
# This exists because Tauri's own dmg target cannot work on CI: bundle_dmg.sh
# arranges the window by driving Finder over AppleScript, and a headless runner
# has no Finder session — the step ran, reported nothing, and shipped a disk
# image with no .DS_Store at all, which Finder then renders as a plain folder.
# dmgbuild writes the .DS_Store itself, so the layout survives.
#
# Geometry is shared with src-tauri/dmg/background.svg: window_rect's size is
# that image's size, and icon_locations are the centres it was drawn around.
# Change one, change the other.
