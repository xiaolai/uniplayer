 * **Five files carry the version, and there is no way to collapse them into
 * one.** `tauri.conf.json` can be pointed at a package.json instead of holding
 * a literal, but the release workflow reads that literal (`jq -r '.version'`)
 * to decide whether a push is a release at all — so making it indirect would
 * mean the gate no longer sees a version to compare. Cargo cannot read a
 * version from JSON in any form. So they are written, not derived, and this
 * script is what keeps that from being five manual edits.
 *
 * Drift here is silent, which is the reason to have this at all: `package-lock`
 * had been sitting at **0.1.0** since the first commit, because nothing ever
 * reads it out loud. Hence the no-argument mode, which is a check rather than a
 * write and is worth running before a release.
 *
 * Edits are **surgical**, one anchored line per file, the same principle as
 * `mpv_conf_set` in lib.rs: a JSON round-trip would reformat
 * `tauri.conf.json`'s hand-written inline arrays (measured — it rewrites the
 * `endpoints` array across four lines), and reformatting a file to change six
 * characters buries the change in the diff. Every anchor must match **exactly
 * once**; anything else is a hard error naming the file, because a version bump
 * that quietly skipped a file is precisely the bug this exists to end.
