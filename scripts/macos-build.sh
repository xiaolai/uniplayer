# The macOS bundle build — `npm run tauri:macos:build`.
#
# A wrapper rather than a line in package.json because one decision has to be
# made before the build starts: **the hardened runtime is only turned on when
# there is a real certificate to pair it with.**
#
# The two are not independent. The hardened runtime enables library validation,
# which requires every dylib the process loads to carry the same Team ID as the
# process itself — and the ~35 libraries in Resources are loaded by the app
# binary at launch. With a Developer ID that is satisfied for free, because
# `macos-sign.sh` signs them with the same identity. With the ad-hoc fallback it
# cannot be satisfied at all: ad-hoc code has no Team ID, so dyld refuses the
# first library and the app dies before `main`, with
#
#   Library not loaded: @rpath/libavutil.60.dylib
#   … not valid for use in process: mapping process and mapped file
#     (non-platform) have different Team IDs
#
# Measured on this project, macOS 26.5. Worth knowing that it does not look like
# a signing problem from the outside: the bundle verifies, `codesign --verify
# --deep --strict` passes silently, and the failure is a crash dialog offering to
# report to Apple. Note also that a probe which `dlopen`s the same libraries
# survives this, so testing the libraries in isolation proves nothing about the
# app — the check that matters is launching the bundle.
#
# So: no identity means no hardened runtime, which is exactly the build the
# project shipped for its first thirty releases and which anyone can produce
# from a clean checkout with no Apple account. The entitlements file stays in
# the config either way; without the hardened runtime it is inert.
