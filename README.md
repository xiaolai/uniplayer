# UniPlayer

A macOS video player built on mpv, with a library-first interface.

## Personal project

UniPlayer is a personal project, published for personal use. Builds are made
for its author's own machines; there is no support commitment, no roadmap, and
no promise that a change will suit anyone else's setup. Issues and pull
requests may go unanswered.

The current version is 0.1.6 (build 7). Builds are ad hoc signed unless a
development team is configured.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask xiaolai/tap/uniplayer
```

Requires macOS 27 or later. The universal build contains Apple silicon and
Intel binaries. This personal build is ad hoc signed and is not notarized;
macOS may require Privacy & Security → Open Anyway on first launch.

## Relationship to IINA

UniPlayer began as a fork of [IINA](https://github.com/iina/iina), and that
origin is why it exists at all. The interface has since been restructured: the
library, inline player, channels and AI inspector are new work, and the
presentation layer no longer follows upstream's window model.

Upstream is no longer tracked. This repository has no `upstream` remote and does
not merge IINA changes; fixes and features are made here. The engine and plugin
API remain IINA's, and the original copyright notices and third-party licences
in [`uniplayer/Credits.rtf`](uniplayer/Credits.rtf) are retained.
