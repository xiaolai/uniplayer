/**
 * Casting to TV (Google Cast): the frontend half of cast.rs.
 *
 * While a session is active the player window is a remote control: mpv sits
 * paused on the file it already has, the position flows *back* from the TV
 * (polled at 2 Hz; Rust extrapolates between the receiver's 1 Hz reports), and
 * disconnecting hands playback to mpv at the TV's position. None of the local
 * seek machinery applies here — the probe, the exact/keyframe split and the
 * drag settle are all about local decode cost, and the TV has its own.
 *
 * Depends on `player` the way `history` does: reads its mirrors, never the
 * other way round.
