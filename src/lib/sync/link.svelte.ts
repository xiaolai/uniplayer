/**
 * `uniplayer://join/<code>` — an invitation somebody clicked.
 *
 * The link exists because a room code alone is a thing to be dictated, and
 * because "click this and you are watching with me" is the whole of what a
 * viewer wants to do with it. What it deliberately is *not* is a way to reach
 * anything else: exactly one shape is understood, and everything else is
 * ignored in silence rather than guessed at. A custom scheme is a surface any
 * page on the internet can aim at, so it may only ever do the one harmless
 * thing — open a dialog with a code typed into it.
 *
 * Which is also why joining is **offered and not performed**. A link that
 * silently pulled a viewer out of what they were watching and into a stranger's
 * room would be a far worse bargain than one extra click, and the dialog is
 * where the room's server address lives anyway — a link naming a relay this
 * player has never heard of has to be looked at rather than obeyed.
 *
 * Two arrivals, one handler. On macOS the link is an Apple Event that the
 * deep-link plugin turns into `deep-link://new-url`; on Windows it is the argv
 * of a second process, which single-instance forwards and `deliver_deep_links`
 * re-emits under the same name. The frontend therefore has one subscription
 * rather than two code paths for one link.
