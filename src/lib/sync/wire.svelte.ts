/**
 * The connection to a room: the socket, the clock offset, and the one function
 * everything else in the player calls to say that the timeline moved.
 *
 * **This module imports nothing from the player, and that is load-bearing.**
 * `playback.svelte.ts` and `seek.svelte.ts` publish into it, and both of those
 * already sit high in the import graph — `playback` reaches `cast`, `seek`
 * reaches `thumbs`. If the bus reached back for `player` or `cast` to *apply*
 * what arrives, that would be a cycle, and a cycle here costs no error and no
 * warning: the bundler resolves it and leaves a module-evaluation order nobody
 * chose (`npm run check-imports` is what says so out loud). So the bus is cut in
 * two along that line — publishing goes *down* into this leaf, and applying goes
 * *up*, in `apply.svelte.ts`, which is above everything and is reached only
 * through the callbacks registered here.
 *
 * The one thing worth knowing about the shape of the wire: what travels is the
 * **timeline after a change, never the change**. A replayed action ("seek back
 * five") is not idempotent, does not survive a dropped message, and cannot
 * answer the only question a late-joining or lagging viewer has, which is where
 * they should be *now*. A snapshot answers all three.
