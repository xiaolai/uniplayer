   * misses what actually happens: options are **removed between mpv versions**
   * (0.41 dropped `--alpha` in favour of `--background`), so a config that
   * worked for a year stops working on an upgrade the viewer never asked for,
   * and it takes the player with it.
   *
   * The failure is also the worst shape it could be. Nothing crashes: the
   * window opens, the start screen draws, everything looks alive — and then the
   * first file hangs for ever on "opening…", because it is being handed to an
   * mpv that was never initialized. Nothing on screen connects that to a line
   * in a text file.
   *
   * So the viewer's half is dropped and init is retried without it, with mpv's
   * own message kept: it names the offending option, which is the one thing
   * needed to fix the file. Our own defaults stay strict — a failure there is a
   * bug in this file rather than a configuration, and starting anyway would
   * hide it. Retrying after a failed `init` may itself not be allowed by the
   * plugin, and that costs nothing: the second failure lands on the same
   * `initError` the single attempt used to produce.

 * untouched. Same file, same window: QuickTime's mid-grey is 140 of 255 and
 * ours 129, and the difference is the whole of the "mpv is darker" complaint.
 *
 * The four values are the one combination that matched, to about one level
 * across the grey scale and to the unit on the six primaries:
 *
 * - `format=gamma=gamma2.2` re-labels the source as a pure power, so that
 * - `gamma-factor` 2.2/1.961 turns it into the 1.961 AVFoundation uses;
 * - `target-trc=srgb` encodes the result with the curve the display expects,
 * - which mpv 0.41 quietly treats as a pure 2.2 unless
 *   `treat-srgb-as-power22=no` — without it the shadows came out lifted by up
 *   to eight levels.
 *
 * **No ICC profile**, although the recipe this started from (IINA's) has one.
 * Our layer already goes through ColorSync as sRGB, so mpv converting to the
 * display profile as well colour-manages the picture twice: the tone curve
 * came out right and every primary desaturated (BT.709 red is 232,51,35 in
 * QuickTime and 213,68,49 with `icc-profile-auto`).
 *
 * The filter carries a label for the same reason `@fpnorm` does — it can be
