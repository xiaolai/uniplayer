/**
 * The catalog: finding something to watch, and the release that carries it.
 *
 * Two questions with two answers, and keeping them apart is the design. TMDB
 * says *what* — posters, localised titles, how many seasons — and an indexer
 * says *where from*: trackers, quality, dubs, seeders, a magnet. Both calls are
 * made in Rust (`catalog.rs`), for the `User-Agent` and to keep an arbitrary
 * user-supplied host out of the webview's fetch surface.
 *
 * **Metadata goes through our own proxy** (`services/tmdb`), which holds the
 * TMDB key — the player carries none. Posters are the exception and go straight
 * to TMDB's CDN wherever that works, which is most places and is where the
 * bandwidth actually is; see `posterUrl`.
 *
 * **This module composes rather than reimplements.** A chosen release is a
 * magnet, and a magnet already has one road into the player — `openTorrent`,
 * with its resolve, its file picker, its history and its queue. Nothing here
 * touches the torrent client.
 *
 * Both addresses are settings rather than constants for the same reason the
 * relay's is: running your own is a setting, not a fork. Empty means the
 * default, so clearing a field restores it instead of turning the feature off —
 * there is a separate switch for that.
