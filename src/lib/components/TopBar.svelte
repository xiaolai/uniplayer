     Stacked below the torrent chip rather than beside it: both are top-right

       what it looks like is the player ignoring you. A button is the opposite
       case: this is the only thing on screen that names the room, so it is also
       the obvious thing to press to see who is in it.

       What the rule still costs is the faded state. While idle this is at zero
