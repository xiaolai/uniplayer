  /* The catalog, marked out by a gradient hairline.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     **Why not simply colour it in.** Indigo means one thing in this player —
     selected / on / primary / focused — so a second indigo *fill* beside
     "Открыть файл" would be two primaries, i.e. none. A 1px gradient ring is a
     different token from a flat fill and can therefore carry a different
     meaning: *this one is worth knowing about*. It is the one place a second
     hue appears in the palette, and the gradient is what makes it read as a
     gradient at all — indigo shading into indigo is invisible at a hairline,
     so the violet end is doing the work rather than decorating.

     **Drawn as an SVG stroke, and the two shapes it is not are both worth
     knowing.** The usual `padding-box`/`border-box` double-gradient trick needs
     an opaque fill behind the interior, and this button's fill is transparent
     and *changes on hover* — so it would have to hardcode the start screen's
     own colour and then track the hover state as well.

     The shape that shipped first was a masked `::before`: a gradient rectangle
     with its middle punched out by `mask-composite: exclude`, i.e. the ring was
     the **difference between two rectangles** rather than a drawn line. Its
     thickness was therefore never painted anywhere — it was whatever survived
     after the outer (`border-box`) and inner (`content-box`) mask rects had
     each been snapped to the device-pixel grid, independently. That is exact on
     macOS, where the device ratio is 2 and a 1px ring is two whole device
     pixels, and it falls apart on Windows: the button sits at a fractional
     offset by construction (`.start-actions` centres a wrapping flex row, so
     any odd difference of widths puts it on a half pixel), and Windows adds a
     fractional device ratio at 125 %/150 % on top. Reported from a Windows
     build: the ring **thinner along the bottom and clipped at every corner but
     the top-left** — which is exactly the signature of that snapping, since the
     box origin rounds outward and keeps its pixel while the far edges round
     inward and lose theirs, and the corners, where the ring is drawn by the
     rounded clip alone against a square inner rect, lose the most.

     A stroke has no such arithmetic: it is one line with a width, antialiased
     evenly on all four sides whatever fraction its box lands on. Measured
     against the built stylesheet in both engines — headless Chrome at ratios 1,
     1.25 and 1.5, a WKWebView harness at 2 — with the paint integrated over
     each 8×8 corner quadrant and normalised to one fully covered pixel of the
     same line, so a stroke, a mask and an ordinary CSS border are directly
     comparable (a 1px line around a quarter arc of radius 7.5 is π/2 · 7.5 ≈
     11.8 whatever draws it):

       ratio 1.25, Blink   mask 5.7–8.9  stroke 10.1–11.1  border 7.1–7.8
       ratio 1,    Blink   mask 10.4–11.2  stroke 10.3–10.4  border 10.3–10.5
       ratio 2,    WebKit  mask 11.1–11.3  stroke 11.7–11.8  border 11.8

     The middle row is the bug: at 1.25 the mask keeps 8.9 at the top-left
     corner and 5.7 at the bottom-right, i.e. it loses over a third of the
     corner, and only there. The sides say the same thing — at 1.25 the mask
     paints its left edge over two full device pixels and each of the other
     three over one, which is the "bottom is a pixel thinner" half of the
     report. What the stroke buys is evenness rather than perfection: its four
     sides land within 3 % of each other at every ratio measured and its corners
     within 16 % at the worst of them, against the mask's 36 % — and at ratios 1
     and 2 its corners are an ordinary border's to the tenth.

     Not animated, deliberately. A slowly rotating gradient is the obvious next
     step and it is wrong here: this is the screen the player sits on whenever
     nothing is playing, and permanent motion in the corner of the eye is
     fatiguing rather than inviting. */

       plain border of the button standing next to it (measured in a WKWebView
       harness against the built stylesheet back when this was a `::before`: the

       an over-constrained absolute box then drops `right`/`bottom` instead of
       the width. Measured in headless Chrome against the built stylesheet: with
       the insets alone the ring's left and top edges landed on the button and
       its right and bottom edges were 300px and 150px away, i.e. off the button
       entirely — a 6px sweep inward from either found nothing painted at all.
       (app.css's `svg { width: 14px }` had been hiding that, which is why it
       also has to be overridden rather than deleted.) Percentages resolve
       against the containing block, which for an absolute box is the *padding*

     half a pixel inside the box for the line to cover exactly one device pixel;
     writing that half into the *layout* (`left: -0.5px`) does not survive,
     because Blink snaps a box's paint offset to whole pixels — measured in
     headless Chrome, the stroke then straddled the padding-box edge and came
     out as two pixels at 44 % each, i.e. dimmer than the border beside it,
     which is what this whole change exists to avoid. Inside the SVG nothing
     snaps: the geometry is user units on a box whose own origin is already
     integral. `rx` is 7.5 for the same reason — plus the stroke's half-width it

     hypothetical: it kept `position: absolute`, and with no positioned ancestor

     direction: every hover here lightens.

     **Visible at rest, unlike the recents cards and the queue** — and that is a
     difference in what the list is for, not an inconsistency. There, deletion
     is a rare correction to a list whose point is playing something, so hiding

     section exists: this is the only place disk usage is shown and the only
     place it can be reclaimed. And a row from the older layout has its open

       otherwise the scrollbar reaches the top of the window and runs into the
       window controls. Centering then happens within the remaining area, which
       is arguably more correct for the start screen anyway — the bar occupies
       the top regardless. */

       goes BOTH ways, and the top of the content is cut off — it cannot be
       scrolled to, the scrollbar does not go there. With `safe`, centering
       applies only while the content fits, and beyond that the layout is
       pinned to the start. */

       This was `overflow-y: auto` + `scrollbar-gutter: stable both-edges`, and
       on macOS the gutter is not honoured at all — so the shift it was written
       to prevent was happening in full. Measured in a WKWebView harness: a
       centered 200px child in a 400px box sat at 100/100 while the content fit
       and at **90/110** once it scrolled. Chromium did honour it (100/100 in
       both), so this was a macOS-only defect, and `CSS.supports` reports the
       property as supported on both.

       Forcing the bar on reserves its 10px on the right in either engine, and
       an equal padding on the left mirrors it. Measured: 100/100 in all four
       combinations of engine and overflow. It also costs 10px less width than
       `both-edges` did on Chromium, which reserved a gutter on each side. */
